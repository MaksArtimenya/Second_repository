Dear, I fear we're facing a problem
You love me no longer, I know and
Maybe there is nothing that I can do
To make you do
Mama tells me I shouldn't bother
That I ought just stick to another man
A man that surely deserves me
But I think you do
So I cry and I pray and I beg
Love me love me
Say that you love me
Fool me fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me love me
Pretend that you love me
Leave me leave me
Just say that you need me
So, I cry and I beg for you to
Love me love me
Say that you love me
Leave me leave me
Just say that you need me
